    "# How to place orders electronically via the JockMKT api with no coding experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install python\n",
    "\n",
    "    [DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. open your terminal (windows: Ctrl + Shift + P, mac: search + open terminal)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In your terminal type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``pip install pandas``\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``pip install jockmkt-sdk``\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``pip install numpy``\n",
    "\n",
    "    if this doesn't work, preface each line with ``python3 -m``\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make sure you get your API keys from developers@jockmkt.com\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Go to the JockMKT web app and choose your event.\n",
    "    - Adjacent to the name of the event, above the players, is a small image of a sheet with \"csv\" on it. Download this CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Open this CSV in Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Add two columns: One titled \"price\" and one titled \"quantity\" (Ensure that they are all lowercase, or this will not work.)\n",
    "    - Add prices and quantities for every player that you want to place a bid on. \n",
    "        - ***LEAVE price, quantity BLANK FOR ANY player YOU DO NOT WANT TO BID ON***\n",
    "    - Save the file somewhere you'll be able to find it!\n",
    "    - **DO NOT CHANGE FILE NAME**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Insert your secret and api keys between the quotation marks on lines 6 and 7 (api_key, secret_key)\n",
    "    - Your *API key* starts with \"jm_key\"\n",
    "    - Your *secret key* is a string of length 32, made of random numbers and letters\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Insert the path to your CSV between the quotation marks on line 11 (path_to_csv)\n",
    "    - FINDING YOUR FILEPATH:\n",
    "\n",
    "        [MAC](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-file-folder-and-disk-information-on-mac-mchlp1774/mac)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        [WINDOWS](https://www.softwareok.com/?seite=faq-Windows-10&faq=40)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Decide whether you want the script to sleep until just before the event before placing your orders:\n",
    "    - On line 15: \n",
    "        - sleep = True if you want to sleep\n",
    "        - sleep = False if you do not want to sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Run the script! How to do this depends on your text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you choose to download VSCode, I suggest the Jupyter Notebook extension.\n",
